Development Environment Data:
    Viewport Width:  2554
    Viewport Height: 1274

    Math:
        Let the function f(w,x) be defined as w*round(x/w). This function will output the nearest number to the input (x) that is a perfect multiple of w.
        Let the function g(V,S) be defined as floor((S/V)*100) to represent the inputted pixel count (P) as a percentage of the viewport size (either width or height)
        bidirectional margin for content: f(16,644) = 640 -- The input (a test of preferred margin, x=644) rounded to the nearest multiple of w=16.
            LEFT+RIGHT MARGIN: 640 px
                vw representation: 25vw
        
        Logo Height: 96 px

        Bottom margin between page contents:
            f(16,225) = 224
            BOTTOM MARGIN VH REPRESENTATION = g(1274, 224) = 17vh
